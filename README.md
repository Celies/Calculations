# Calculations
A java class containing several calculations in 2D and 3D space

These calculations are stuff I used for another project, which I thought was pretty fun to do, so I wanted to set up a new class that I could use for other projects in the future. Main use would be in 2D games and the like. 

TODO <br>
More JUnit test to increase coverage. <br>
A 3D varaint of the interception method. <br>
Comments to acutally explain the mathematics and maybe links to theorems that is used. <br>
Methods that return an interception point in 2D/3D space instead of the radians. <br>
Methods that return time to interception. <br>
